# Chatbot with Gemini API in Flutter

This Flutter project is a fully-featured chatbot that utilizes the [Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) to provide interactive and intelligent conversational experiences. This chatbot can memorize past interactions, save chats in local storage, and allows users to interact with images from their camera and gallery.

## Features

- **Chatbot Integration**: Real-time chatbot responses via the Gemini API.
- **Memory Support**: The chatbot remembers past conversations, making interactions more contextual and personalized.
- **Local Storage**: Save chat history securely using local storage.
- **Image Integration**: Capture images from the camera or pick images from the gallery to enhance interaction.
